                  Version 3.1
                 Release Notes


Introduction
------------

Awake FILE is a secure Open Source framework that allows to program very 
easily file uploads/downloads, remote file access and RPC through http. 
File transfers include powerful features like file chunking and automatic 
recovery mechanism.

Security has been taken into account from the design: server side allows 
to specify strong security rules in order to protect the files and to
secure the RPC calls.

Awake FILE is licensed through the GNU Lesser General Public License 
(LGPL v2.1): you can use it for free and without any constraints in your 
open source projects and in your commercial applications.


Awake FILE Version 3.1 - 21-oct-2015
------------------------------------

What's New:

- This version drops Apache HttpClient for HTTP communications in favor of
  native JRE java.net.HttpUrlConnection. This is due to several reasons:
  1) Apache HTTP Client Removal by Google in Android 6.0:
     http://goo.gl/Hwa1yN. It would thus require Android developers a dirty
     turn around to include back the Apache HTTP Client library.
  2) It would be very hard for us to code, test, maintain an HttpClient port  
     compatible with both Android/Dalvik and Java Desktop. There is an
     Apache port to Android, but it's not compatible with Desktop JRE.
  3) We don't use Apache HttpClient/HttpCore advanced features.
  4) Following our tests, fine tuned java.net.HttpUrlConnection performances 
     are the same or better as HttpClient.
     (See HttpClient developer's own benchmark at http://goo.gl/T1HFg6:
     magnitude is the same).
  5) HttpUrlConnection has better support for NTLM and Kerberos 
     authentication.
  6) There are 1Mb less dependencies to ship around using native library.

- We thus have rewritten our HTTP layer and did some
  performance optimization.
  
- This version now supports HTTP compression.
  See org.kawanfw.commons.api.SessionParameters for configuration.

- The org.kawanfw.commons.api.client.HttpProxy class has been removed, 
  because it would limit proxy types support and acted only as
  a java.net.Proxy class wrapper, just adding cumbersome code.
  java.net.Proxy must now directly be used instead, and allows both
  HTTP and SOCKS proxy support.
  This is better/cleaner for code development and maintenance.
  
- org.kawanfw.commons.api.client.HttpProtocolParameters was renamed to 
  org.kawanfw.commons.api.client.SessionParameters.
  The old name was inaccurate. 
  setCompressionOn(), setConnectTimeout() and
  setReadTimeout() have been added, see Javadoc and Tutorial.
  The methods referring to Apache HttpClient 
  settings have been removed. setDownloadBufferSize() and 
  setUploadBufferSize() have been removed: standard 4096 size
  is used. 
  
- There is no more dedicated Android distribution. 
  There are now  1) a jar for client side (all OS and Android): 
  awake-file-client-3.1.jar  and 2) a jar for the server side : 
  awake-file-server-3.1.jar.

Please note that HttpProxy & HttpProtocolParameters have not been 
deprecated, but suppressed/renamed in order to keep a clean and 
uncluttered API. 
 


Awake FILE Version 3.0 - 26-mar-2015
------------------------------------

New features:

- New client class RemoteSession replaces deprecated FileSession 
  for session establishment.
  
- New client class RemoteFile allows easy file method execution on 
  remote files, with exactly same method signature and behavior 
  as in java.io.File.
  Example: RemoteFile.exists() will call a File.exists() on remote
  server and return the result.
  
- new CommonsConfigurator concrete class SshAuthCommonsConfigurator allows 
  zero-code (usernname, password) authentication. Authentication is done 
  against the host SSH server with the login(username, password) method.
  
- DefaultCommonsConfigurator.addSecretForAuthToken() has been enhanced and
  does not return null anymore. It returns now the concatenation of 
  server specific values hard/impossible to guess by the client side.
  
- New method RemoteSession.getRemoteJavaVersion() allows to retrieve
  the Java version of the servlet container from client side.
  
- UrlSession has been deprecated: no real usage advantage 
  over java.net.URLConnection.
  
- Undocumented API package org.kawanfw.file.api.server.fileaction has been
  modified, renamed and is not any more visible.
  
- FileSession has been deprecated: 
  session establishment is now to be done using RemoteSession class 
  and operations on remote file using RemoteFile class.
  
- FileSession has been retrofitted: session establishment  
  internally uses new RemoteSession class and file method calls 
  internally use new RemoteFile class methods.
  
- We have kept a 2.0 to 3.0 full upgrade compatibility by 
  deprecating FileSession instead of removing the class 
  (which is our standard policy): the existing code changes would 
  be too heavy for existing 2.0 applications and would have discouraged 
  our users base to adopt/install this new version.
  
- So, your previous 2.0 client code using FileSession will run without 
  any modification. Same with server side.
  
  
Fixed bugs:

- Server side would brutally interrupt the ServerFileManager 
  servlet with a 500 code if a client called method FileSession.call() 
  and the called method was missing some dependencies. 
  This has been fixed: a clean ClassNotFoundException is now thrown.


Upgrading from previous version 2.0:

- Binary compatible both on client and server side.

- WARNING: client libraries must be redeployed because 
  internal client/server protocol has been rewritten. 


Awake FILE Version 2.0.2 - 04-feb-2015
--------------------------------------

Fixed bugs:
- Client side classes RemoteInputStream & RemoteOutputStream called
  server side org.kawanfw.commons.api.server.util.Sha1 API. This could
  cause a problem when generating Android client side jar and other
  third parties client side jars, or when using obfuscation as documented.
  This has been fixed.
  
Misc:
- Code refactor. Some commons classes where stored in org.kawanfw.file.*
  packages. They have been moved to org.kawanfw.commons.* packages.
- Some Javadoc spelling errors have been fixed.

  
Awake FILE Version 2.0.1 - 27-jan-2015
--------------------------------------

Fixed bugs:
- DefaultCommonsConfigurator.getConnection() could throw an unrecoverable
  NullPointerException if ServerFileManager servlet was tested before
  first client side call. This has been fixed.
- UTF-8 character encoding was not always forced on server side. This has 
  been fixed.

Awake FILE Version 2.0 - 20-jan-2015
------------------------------------

New features:
- New FileSession.rename method allows to rename files on the server.
- New classes RemoteInputStream & RemoteOutputStream allow
  to use InputStream & OutputStream for file transfers when progress
  indicators are needed.
- All file transfer operations have been internally retrofitted with new 
  RemoteInputStream & RemoteOutputStream. They are now the core classes of the
  framework for file uploads & downloads.
- Progress monitor helper interface TransferProgressManager and implementation 
  class DefaultTransferProgressManager have thus been suppressed: they are not
  needed anymore as RemoteInputStream & RemoteOutputStream allow easy 
  implementation of progress indicators. See Tutorial & included examples.
- HttpTransferInterruptedException is suppressed (InterruptedException should be
  throwned when an InputStream/OutputStream read/write is cancelled by the progress
  monitor. 
- Uses now Google Gson version 2.3.1.

Please note that we prefer to suppress brutally than to deprecate 
unnecessary classes and methods. This favors keeping a clean and uncluttered API.
  
Upgrading from previous version 1.5:
- Not binary compatible both on client and server side: you 
  need to change and recompile your source code.
- WARNING: client libraries must be redeployed because 
  internal client/server protocol has been modified. 
  

Awake FILE Version 1.5 - 12-aug-2014
------------------------------------

New features:
- Root package name has been changed from "org.awakefw" to "org.kawanfw".
- APIs names change. Classes names have been shortened in sake of implicity and 
  the "Awake" word has been removed from all classes and methods.
- Uses new 3.3.2 version of Apache Commons Lang.
- Uses new 1.1.3 version of Apache Commons Logging.

Fixed bugs:
- In some cases, SSL/TLS url wtarting with "https://" could not be used. 
  This has been fixed.

Please note that old API classes and method names have not been deprecated,
but suppressed in order to keep a clean and uncluttered API.

This table describes the renamed API classes:

Old Name                        New Name

- Not binary compatible both on client and server side: you
  need to change and recompile your source code.
- WARNING: client libraries must be redeployed because 
  internal client/server protocol has been modified. 


Awake FILE Version 1.4 - 22-apr-2014
------------------------------------

New features:
- File chunking is now supported for both upload & download.
  Files are now chunked when downloaded with AwakeFileSession.download(). 
  Default chunk length is 100 Mb. Chunking allows to download files with
  no size limit. 
- Awake FILE now supports recovery for large files upload and download.
  See Tutorial for how to and examples.
- Methods in AwakeFileSession now throw SocketException to be cleaner. 
  This has no impact on calling/user code.
- Thrown exceptions are better described in Tutorial and include
  SocketException and HttpTransferInterruptedException.
  
Upgrading from previous version 1.3.3b:
- Binary compatible both on client and server side: you don't 
  need to recompile your source code.

Previous Versions
-----------------

Awake FILE Version 1.3.3b - 15-apr-2014
---------------------------------------

Fixed bugs:
- Jars contained example code that could cause potential conflict.
  The example code has been removed.

Awake FILE Version 1.3.3 - 14-apr-2014
--------------------------------------

New features:
- Client side is now always repeatable.  
  HttpProtocolParameters.setRepeatable(boolean repeatable) is now
  deprecated and does nothing.
  Client side is always repeatable for 2 reasons: a) execution
  is faster, b) it's safer with proxies and with slow or 
  overloaded networks.
- It is now possible to define the number of times the HttpRequest 
  should  be retried after a recoverable exception during execution. 
  See HttpProtocolParameters.setRetryCount(int retryCount).

Upgrading from previous version 1.3.2:
- Binary compatible both on client and server side: you don't 
  need to recompile your source code.
- WARNING: client libraries must be redeployed because 
  internal client/server protocol has been modified.  


Awake FILE Version 1.3.2 - 9-apr-2014
-------------------------------------

New features:
- Malformed responses coming from server side, aka not starting with 
  SEND_OK or SEND_FAILED, were always reported as an user configuration
  failure (URL not corresponding to an Awake servlet).
  This was not always true, as the server error message 
  could appear after a communication problem, a proxy failure, etc. 
  The new message is cleaner, complete, give details about 
  possible errors and displays the URL for easier debug.

Upgrading from previous version 1.3.1:
- Binary compatible both on client and server side: you don't 
  need to recompile your source code.
  
Awake FILE Version 1.3.1 - 3-apr-2014
-------------------------------------

New features:
- Proxy authentication is done once per session when using a proxy. 
  This allows 25% speed gain.
- It is possible to force client side to be repeatable. Default behavior 
  is non repeatable, except when using a proxy. 
  See org.awakefw.commons.api.client.HttpProtocolParameters for usage.

Fixed bugs:
- File upload was not repeatable when using a proxy. 
  Upload thus could fail with some proxies. This has been fixed and file 
  upload is now always repeatable when using a proxy.

Upgrading from previous version 1.3:
- Binary compatible both on client and server side: you don't 
  need to recompile your source code.
  
  
Awake FILE Version 1.3 - 10-feb-2014
------------------------------------

New features:
- Files are now chunked when uploaded with AwakeFileSession.upload(). 
  Default chunk length is 100 Mb. Chunking allows to upload files with
  no size limit. 
- Client AwakeFileSession & AwakeUrl API classes are not anymore marked 
  final. This will allow to stub or Mock client API classes for Unit 
  tests.  

Misc:
- Javadoc corrections.
