Introduction
------------

Awake FILE is a secure Open Source framework that allows to program very 
easily file uploads/downloads, remote file access and RPC through http. 
File transfers include powerful features like file chunking and automatic 
recovery mechanism.

Security has been taken into account from the design: server side allows 
to specify strong security rules in order to protect the files and to
secure the RPC calls.

Awake FILE is licensed through the GNU Lesser General Public License

open source projects and in your commercial applications.
